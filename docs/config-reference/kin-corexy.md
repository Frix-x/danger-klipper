## Common kinematic settings

### CoreXY Kinematics

See [example-corexy.cfg](../../config/example-corexy.cfg) for an example
corexy (and h-bot) kinematics file.

Only parameters specific to corexy printers are described here - see
[[printer]](printer.md) for available parameters.

```
[printer]
kinematics: corexy
max_z_velocity:
#   This sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of movement along the z
#   axis. This setting can be used to restrict the maximum speed of
#   the z stepper motor. The default is to use max_velocity for
#   max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel:
#   This sets the maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of movement along
#   the z axis. It limits the acceleration of the z stepper motor. The
#   default is to use max_accel for max_z_accel.

# The stepper_x section is used to describe the X axis as well as the
# stepper controlling the X+Y movement.
[stepper_x]

# The stepper_y section is used to describe the Y axis as well as the
# stepper controlling the X-Y movement.
[stepper_y]

# The stepper_z section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the Z axis.
[stepper_z]
