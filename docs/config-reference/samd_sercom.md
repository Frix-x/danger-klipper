## Board specific hardware support

### [samd_sercom]

SAMD SERCOM configuration to specify which pins to use on a given
SERCOM. One may define any number of sections with a "samd_sercom"
prefix. Each SERCOM must be configured prior to using it as SPI or I2C
peripheral. Place this config section above any other section that
makes use of SPI or I2C buses.

```
[samd_sercom my_sercom]
sercom:
#   The name of the sercom bus to configure in the micro-controller.
#   Available names are "sercom0", "sercom1", etc.. This parameter
#   must be provided.
tx_pin:
#   MOSI pin for SPI communication, or SDA (data) pin for I2C
#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.
#rx_pin:
#   MISO pin for SPI communication. This pin is not used for I2C
#   communication (I2C uses tx_pin for both sending and receiving).
#   The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration for the given
#   SERCOM peripheral. This parameter is optional.
clk_pin:
#   CLK pin for SPI communication, or SCL (clock) pin for I2C
#   communication. The pin must have a valid pinmux configuration
#   for the given SERCOM peripheral. This parameter must be provided.
