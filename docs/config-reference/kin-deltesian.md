# Configuration reference

## Common kinematic settings

### Deltesian Kinematics

See [example-deltesian.cfg](../../config/example-deltesian.cfg) for an
example deltesian kinematics config file.

Only parameters specific to deltesian printers are described here - see
[[printer]](printer.md) for available parameters.

```
[printer]
kinematics: deltesian
max_z_velocity:
#   For deltesian printers, this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a deltesian printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
#max_z_accel:
#   This sets the maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of movement along
#   the z axis. Setting this may be useful if the printer can reach higher
#   acceleration on XY moves than Z moves (eg, when using input shaper).
#   The default is to use max_accel for max_z_accel.
#minimum_z_position: 0
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to. The default is 0.
#min_angle: 5
#   This represents the minimum angle (in degrees) relative to horizontal
#   that the deltesian arms are allowed to achieve. This parameter is
#   intended to restrict the arms from becoming completely horizontal,
#   which would risk accidental inversion of the XZ axis. The default is 5.
#print_width:
#   The distance (in mm) of valid toolhead X coordinates. One may use
#   this setting to customize the range checking of toolhead moves. If
#   a large value is specified here then it may be possible to command
#   the toolhead into a collision with a tower. This setting usually
#   corresponds to bed width (in mm).
#slow_ratio: 3
#   The ratio used to limit velocity and acceleration on moves near the
#   extremes of the X axis. If vertical distance divided by horizontal
#   distance exceeds the value of slow_ratio, then velocity and
#   acceleration are limited to half their nominal values. If vertical
#   distance divided by horizontal distance exceeds twice the value of
#   the slow_ratio, then velocity and acceleration are limited to one
#   quarter of their nominal values. The default is 3.

# The stepper_left section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the left tower. This section also controls the homing parameters
# (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all towers.
[stepper_left]
position_endstop:
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstops are triggered. This
#   parameter must be provided for stepper_left; for stepper_right this
#   parameter defaults to the value specified for stepper_left.
arm_length:
#   Length (in mm) of the diagonal rod that connects the tower carriage to
#   the print head. This parameter must be provided for stepper_left; for
#   stepper_right, this parameter defaults to the value specified for
#   stepper_left.
arm_x_length:
#   Horizontal distance between the print head and the tower when the
#   printers is homed. This parameter must be provided for stepper_left;
#   for stepper_right, this parameter defaults to the value specified for
#   stepper_left.

# The stepper_right section is used to describe the stepper controlling the
# right tower.
[stepper_right]

# The stepper_y section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the Y axis in a deltesian robot.
[stepper_y]
