# Configuration reference

## Display support

### [display_glyph]

Display a custom glyph on displays that support it. The given name
will be assigned the given display data which can then be referenced
in the display templates by their name surrounded by two "tilde"
symbols i.e. `~my_display_glyph~`

See [sample-glyphs.cfg](../../config/sample-glyphs.cfg) for some
examples.

```
[display_glyph my_display_glyph]
#data:
#   The display data, stored as 16 lines consisting of 16 bits (1 per
#   pixel) where '.' is a blank pixel and '*' is an on pixel (e.g.,
#   "****************" to display a solid horizontal line).
#   Alternatively, one can use '0' for a blank pixel and '1' for an on
#   pixel. Put each display line into a separate config line. The
#   glyph must consist of exactly 16 lines with 16 bits each. This
#   parameter is optional.
#hd44780_data:
#   Glyph to use on 20x4 hd44780 displays. The glyph must consist of
#   exactly 8 lines with 5 bits each. This parameter is optional.
#hd44780_slot:
#   The hd44780 hardware index (0..7) to store the glyph at. If
#   multiple distinct images use the same slot then make sure to only
#   use one of those images in any given screen. This parameter is
#   required if hd44780_data is specified.
