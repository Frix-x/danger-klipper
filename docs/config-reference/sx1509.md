# Configuration reference

## Board specific hardware support

### [sx1509]

Configure an SX1509 I2C to GPIO expander. Due to the delay incurred by
I2C communication you should NOT use SX1509 pins as stepper enable,
step or dir pins or any other pin that requires fast bit-banging. They
are best used as static or gcode controlled digital outputs or
hardware-pwm pins for e.g. fans. One may define any number of sections
with an "sx1509" prefix. Each expander provides a set of 16 pins
(sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_0 to sx1509_my_sx1509:PIN_15) which can be used
in the printer configuration.

See the [generic-duet2-duex.cfg](../../config/generic-duet2-duex.cfg)
file for an example.

```
[sx1509 my_sx1509]
i2c_address:
#   I2C address used by this expander. Depending on the hardware
#   jumpers this is one out of the following addresses: 62 63 112
#   113. This parameter must be provided.
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:
#i2c_software_scl_pin:
#i2c_software_sda_pin:
#i2c_speed:
#   See the "common I2C settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
