# Configuration reference

## TMC stepper driver configuration

### [tmc2130]

Configure a TMC2130 stepper motor driver via SPI bus. To use this
feature, define a config section with a "tmc2130" prefix followed by
the name of the corresponding stepper config section (for example,
"[tmc2130 stepper_x]").

```
[tmc2130 stepper_x]
cs_pin:
#   The pin corresponding to the TMC2130 chip select line. This pin
#   will be set to low at the start of SPI messages and raised to high
#   after the message completes. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed:
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#chain_position:
#chain_length:
#   These parameters configure an SPI daisy chain. The two parameters
#   define the stepper position in the chain and the total chain length.
#   Position 1 corresponds to the stepper that connects to the MOSI signal.
#   The default is to not use an SPI daisy chain.
#interpolate: True
#   If true, enable step interpolation (the driver will internally
#   step at a rate of 256 micro-steps). This interpolation does
#   introduce a small systemic positional deviation - see
#   TMC_Drivers.md for details. The default is True.
run_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during stepper movement. This parameter must be provided.
#hold_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   when the stepper is not moving. Setting a hold_current is not
#   recommended (see TMC_Drivers.md for details). The default is to
#   not reduce the current.
#home_current:
#   The amount of current (in amps RMS) to configure the driver to use
#   during homing procedures. The default is to not reduce the current.
#current_change_dwell_time:
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait after changing homing current.
#   The default is 0.5 seconds.
#sense_resistor: 0.110
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the motor sense resistor. The default
#   is 0.110 ohms.
#stealthchop_threshold: 0
#   The velocity (in mm/s) to set the "stealthChop" threshold to. When
#   set, "stealthChop" mode will be enabled if the stepper motor
#   velocity is below this value. The default is 0, which disables
#   "stealthChop" mode.
#driver_MSLUT0: 2863314260
#driver_MSLUT1: 1251300522
#driver_MSLUT2: 608774441
#driver_MSLUT3: 269500962
#driver_MSLUT4: 4227858431
#driver_MSLUT5: 3048961917
#driver_MSLUT6: 1227445590
#driver_MSLUT7: 4211234
#driver_W0: 2
#driver_W1: 1
#driver_W2: 1
#driver_W3: 1
#driver_X1: 128
#driver_X2: 255
#driver_X3: 255
#driver_START_SIN: 0
#driver_START_SIN90: 247
#   These fields control the Microstep Table registers directly. The optimal
#   wave table is specific to each motor and might vary with current. An
#   optimal configuration will have minimal print artifacts caused by
#   non-linear stepper movement. The values specified above are the default
#   values used by the driver. The value must be specified as a decimal integer
#   (hex form is not supported). In order to compute the wave table fields,
#   see the tmc2130 "Calculation Sheet" from the Trinamic website.
#driver_IHOLDDELAY: 8
#driver_TPOWERDOWN: 0
#driver_TBL: 1
#driver_TOFF: 4
#driver_HEND: 7
#driver_HSTRT: 0
#driver_PWM_AUTOSCALE: True
#driver_PWM_FREQ: 1
#driver_PWM_GRAD: 4
#driver_PWM_AMPL: 128
#driver_SGT: 0
#   Set the given register during the configuration of the TMC2130
#   chip. This may be used to set custom motor parameters. The
#   defaults for each parameter are next to the parameter name in the
#   above list.
#diag0_pin:
#diag1_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to one of the DIAG lines of the
#   TMC2130 chip. Only a single diag pin should be specified. The pin
#   is "active low" and is thus normally prefaced with "^!". Setting
#   this creates a "tmc2130_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual pin
#   which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this enables
#   "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGT to an
#   appropriate sensitivity value.) The default is to not enable
#   sensorless homing.
```
