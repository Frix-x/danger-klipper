### [output_pin]

Run-time configurable output pins (one may define any number of
sections with an "output_pin" prefix). Pins configured here will be
setup as output pins and one may modify them at run-time using
"SET_PIN PIN=my_pin VALUE=.1" type extended
[g-code commands](../G-Codes.md#output_pin).

```
[output_pin my_pin]
pin:
#   The pin to configure as an output. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pwm: False
#   Set if the output pin should be capable of pulse-width-modulation.
#   If this is true, the value fields should be between 0 and 1; if it
#   is false the value fields should be either 0 or 1. The default is
#   False.
#value:
#   The value to initially set the pin to during MCU configuration.
#   The default is 0 (for low voltage).
#shutdown_value:
#   The value to set the pin to on an MCU shutdown event. The default
#   is 0 (for low voltage).
#cycle_time: 0.100
#   The amount of time (in seconds) per PWM cycle. It is recommended
#   this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software based PWM.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds for pwm pins.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. When
#   using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is constrained by the
#   implementation and may be significantly different than the
#   requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.
#maximum_mcu_duration:
#static_value:
#   These options are deprecated and should no longer be specified.
