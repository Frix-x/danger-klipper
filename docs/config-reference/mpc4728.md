## Run-time stepper motor current configuration

### [mcp4728]

Statically configured MCP4728 digital-to-analog converter connected
via I2C bus (one may define any number of sections with an "mcp4728"
prefix).

```
[mcp4728 my_dac]
#i2c_address: 96
#   The i2c address that the chip is using on the i2c bus. The default
#   is 96.
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:
#i2c_software_scl_pin:
#i2c_software_sda_pin:
#i2c_speed:
#   See the "common I2C settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#channel_a:
#channel_b:
#channel_c:
#channel_d:
#   The value to statically set the given MCP4728 channel to. This is
#   typically set to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the
#   highest voltage (2.048V) and 0.0 being the lowest voltage.
#   However, the range may be changed with the 'scale' parameter (see
#   below). If a channel is not specified then it is left
#   unconfigured.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'channel_x' parameters
#   are interpreted. If provided, then the 'channel_x' parameters
#   should be between 0.0 and 'scale'. This may be useful when the
#   MCP4728 is used to set stepper voltage references. The 'scale' can
#   be set to the equivalent stepper amperage if the MCP4728 were at
#   its highest voltage (2.048V), and then the 'channel_x' parameters
#   can be specified using the desired amperage value for the
#   stepper. The default is to not scale the 'channel_x' parameters.
