## Run-time stepper motor current configuration

### [ad5206]

Statically configured AD5206 digipots connected via SPI bus (one may
define any number of sections with an "ad5206" prefix).

```
[ad5206 my_digipot]
enable_pin:
#   The pin corresponding to the AD5206 chip select line. This pin
#   will be set to low at the start of SPI messages and raised to high
#   after the message completes. This parameter must be provided.
#spi_speed:
#spi_bus:
#spi_software_sclk_pin:
#spi_software_mosi_pin:
#spi_software_miso_pin:
#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#channel_1:
#channel_2:
#channel_3:
#channel_4:
#channel_5:
#channel_6:
#   The value to statically set the given AD5206 channel to. This is
#   typically set to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the
#   highest resistance and 0.0 being the lowest resistance. However,
#   the range may be changed with the 'scale' parameter (see below).
#   If a channel is not specified then it is left unconfigured.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'channel_x' parameters
#   are interpreted. If provided, then the 'channel_x' parameters
#   should be between 0.0 and 'scale'. This may be useful when the
#   AD5206 is used to set stepper voltage references. The 'scale' can
#   be set to the equivalent stepper amperage if the AD5206 were at
#   its highest resistance, and then the 'channel_x' parameters can be
#   specified using the desired amperage value for the stepper. The
#   default is to not scale the 'channel_x' parameters.
