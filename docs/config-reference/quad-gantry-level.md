## Bed level support

### [quad_gantry_level]

Moving gantry leveling using 4 independently controlled Z motors.
Corrects hyperbolic parabola effects (potato chip) on moving gantry
which is more flexible.
WARNING: Using this on a moving bed may lead to undesirable results.
If this section is present then a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL extended G-Code
command becomes available. This routine assumes the following Z motor
configuration:

```
 ----------------
 |Z1          Z2|
 |  ---------   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  |       |   |
 |  x--------   |
 |Z           Z3|
 ----------------
```

Where x is the 0, 0 point on the bed

[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X, Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X, Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance.
#increasing_threshold: 0.0000001
#   Sets the threshold that probe points can increase before qgl aborts.
#   To disable the validation, set this parameter to a high value.
