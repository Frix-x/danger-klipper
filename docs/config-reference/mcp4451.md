## Run-time stepper motor current configuration

### [mcp4451]

Statically configured MCP4451 digipot connected via I2C bus (one may
define any number of sections with an "mcp4451" prefix).

```
[mcp4451 my_digipot]
i2c_address:
#   The i2c address that the chip is using on the i2c bus. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:
#i2c_software_scl_pin:
#i2c_software_sda_pin:
#i2c_speed:
#   See the "common I2C settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#wiper_0:
#wiper_1:
#wiper_2:
#wiper_3:
#   The value to statically set the given MCP4451 "wiper" to. This is
#   typically set to a number between 0.0 and 1.0 with 1.0 being the
#   highest resistance and 0.0 being the lowest resistance. However,
#   the range may be changed with the 'scale' parameter (see below).
#   If a wiper is not specified then it is left unconfigured.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'wiper_x' parameters
#   are interpreted. If provided, then the 'wiper_x' parameters should
#   be between 0.0 and 'scale'. This may be useful when the MCP4451 is
#   used to set stepper voltage references. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the MCP4451 were at its highest
#   resistance, and then the 'wiper_x' parameters can be specified
#   using the desired amperage value for the stepper. The default is
#   to not scale the 'wiper_x' parameters.
