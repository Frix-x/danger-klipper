# Configuration reference

## Common kinematic settings

### [stepper]

Stepper motor definitions. Different printer types (as specified by
the "kinematics" option in the [printer] config section) require
different names for the stepper (eg, `stepper_x` vs `stepper_a`).
Below are common stepper definitions.

See the [rotation distance document](../Rotation_Distance.md) for
information on calculating the `rotation_distance` parameter. See the
[Multi-MCU homing](../Multi_MCU_Homing.md) document for information on
homing using multiple micro-controllers.

```
[stepper_x]
step_pin:
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin:
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin:
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance:
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.
microsteps:
#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
#step_pulse_duration:
#   The minimum time between the step pulse signal edge and the
#   following "unstep" signal edge. This is also used to set the
#   minimum time between a step pulse and a direction change signal.
#   The default is 0.000000100 (100ns) for TMC steppers that are
#   configured in UART or SPI mode, and the default is 0.000002 (which
#   is 2us) for all other steppers.
endstop_pin:
#   Endstop switch detection pin. If this endstop pin is on a
#   different mcu than the stepper motor then it enables "multi-mcu
#   homing". This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#position_min: 0
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to.  The default is 0mm.
position_endstop:
#   Location of the endstop (in mm). This parameter must be provided
#   for the X, Y, and Z steppers on cartesian style printers.
position_max:
#   Maximum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to. This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#homing_speed: 5.0
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when homing. The default
#   is 5mm/s.
#homing_retract_dist: 5.0
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before homing a second time during
#   homing. If `use_sensorless_homing` is false, this setting can be set
#   to zero to disable the second home. If `use_sensorless_homing` is
#   true, this setting can be > 0 to backoff after homing. The default
#   is 5mm.
#homing_retract_speed:
#   Speed to use on the retract move after homing in case this should
#   be different from the homing speed, which is the default for this
#   parameter
#min_home_dist:
#   Minimum distance (in mm) for toolhead before sensorless homing. If closer
#   than `min_home_dist` to endstop, it moves away to this distance, then homes.
#   If further, it directly homes and retracts to `homing_retract_dist`.
#   The default is equal to `homing_retract_dist`.
#second_homing_speed:
#   Velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when performing the second home.
#   The default is homing_speed/2.
#homing_positive_dir:
#   If true, homing will cause the stepper to move in a positive
#   direction (away from zero); if false, home towards zero. It is
#   better to use the default than to specify this parameter. The
#   default is true if position_endstop is near position_max and false
#   if near position_min.
#use_sensorless_homing:
#   If true, disables the second home action if homing_retract_dist > 0.
#   The default is true if endstop_pin is configured to use virtual_endstop
```
