# Configuration reference

## Display support

### [display my_extra_display]

If a primary [display] section has been defined in printer.cfg as
shown above it is possible to define multiple auxiliary displays. Note
that auxiliary displays do not currently support menu functionality,
thus they do not support the "menu" options or button configuration.

```
[display my_extra_display]
# See the "display" section for available parameters.
```
