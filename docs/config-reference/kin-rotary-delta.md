# Configuration reference

## Common kinematic settings

### Rotary delta Kinematics

See [example-rotary-delta.cfg](../../config/example-rotary-delta.cfg) for
an example rotary delta kinematics config file.

Only parameters specific to rotary delta printers are described here -
see [[printer]](printer.md) for available parameters.

ROTARY DELTA KINEMATICS ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS. Homing moves may
timeout and some boundary checks are not implemented.

```
[printer]
kinematics: rotary_delta
max_z_velocity:
#   For delta printers this limits the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   moves with z axis movement. This setting can be used to reduce the
#   maximum speed of up/down moves (which require a higher step rate
#   than other moves on a delta printer). The default is to use
#   max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
#minimum_z_position: 0
#   The minimum Z position that the user may command the head to move
#   to.  The default is 0.
shoulder_radius:
#   Radius (in mm) of the horizontal circle formed by the three
#   shoulder joints, minus the radius of the circle formed by the
#   effector joints. This parameter may also be calculated as:
#     shoulder_radius = (delta_f - delta_e) / sqrt(12)
#   This parameter must be provided.
shoulder_height:
#   Distance (in mm) of the shoulder joints from the bed, minus the
#   effector toolhead height. This parameter must be provided.

# The stepper_a section describes the stepper controlling the rear
# right arm (at 30 degrees). This section also controls the homing
# parameters (homing_speed, homing_retract_dist) for all arms.
[stepper_a]
gear_ratio:
#   A gear_ratio must be specified and rotation_distance may not be
#   specified. For example, if the arm has an 80 toothed pulley driven
#   by a pulley with 16 teeth, which is in turn connected to a 60
#   toothed pulley driven by a stepper with a 16 toothed pulley, then
#   one would specify a gear ratio of "80:16, 60:16". This parameter
#   must be provided.
position_endstop:
#   Distance (in mm) between the nozzle and the bed when the nozzle is
#   in the center of the build area and the endstop triggers. This
#   parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for stepper_b and
#   stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value specified for
#   stepper_a.
upper_arm_length:
#   Length (in mm) of the arm connecting the "shoulder joint" to the
#   "elbow joint". This parameter must be provided for stepper_a; for
#   stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
lower_arm_length:
#   Length (in mm) of the arm connecting the "elbow joint" to the
#   "effector joint". This parameter must be provided for stepper_a;
#   for stepper_b and stepper_c this parameter defaults to the value
#   specified for stepper_a.
#angle:
#   This option specifies the angle (in degrees) that the arm is at.
#   The default is 30 for stepper_a, 150 for stepper_b, and 270 for
#   stepper_c.

# The stepper_b section describes the stepper controlling the rear
# left arm (at 150 degrees).
[stepper_b]

# The stepper_c section describes the stepper controlling the front
# arm (at 270 degrees).
[stepper_c]

# The delta_calibrate section enables a DELTA_CALIBRATE extended
# g-code command that can calibrate the shoulder endstop positions.
[delta_calibrate]
radius:
#   Radius (in mm) of the area that may be probed. This is the radius
#   of nozzle coordinates to be probed; if using an automatic probe
#   with an XY offset then choose a radius small enough so that the
#   probe always fits over the bed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
